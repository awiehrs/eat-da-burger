  ## **Description**
    
  Eat Da Burger is a single page application that uses full-stack development where the front end communicates with a back end. On the front end, a user can interact with the page by adding a burger of their choice to the menu, and then "Devour" the burger. On the back end, a database logs the name of the new burger, whether it has been devoured or not, and gives it an id to reference internally.
